# Image Path Fix Summary

## Issue
The Next.js portfolio website was not displaying images correctly because:
1. Images were stored in `main/public` directory
2. Next.js was looking for images in the standard `public` directory
3. Path aliases in `tsconfig.json` needed to be updated to correctly resolve components

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Path Aliases
Updated `tsconfig.json` to correctly map the path:
```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
```

### 2. Moved Image Assets
Copied the entire `main/public` directory to the root `public` directory so Next.js can serve the images correctly:
- Copied all images from `main/public` to `public`
- Maintained the same directory structure
- Preserved all image files (43 files total)

### 3. Verified Image References
Confirmed that the `placeholder-images.json` file correctly references the images:
- Local images use relative paths like `/project/Ai website/1.jpg`
- Remote images use full URLs from placeholder services

## Components Using Images
1. **Hero Section** - Profile image
2. **Education & Courses** - Course provider logos and certificates
3. **Projects** - Project screenshots in carousels

## Verification
- Development server is running on port 3009
- Images are now loading correctly
- All components display images as expected
- Both local and remote images are working

## Files Modified
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated path aliases
- `public/` directory - Created and populated with image assets

The website is now fully functional with all images displaying correctly.
